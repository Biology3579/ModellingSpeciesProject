#        Species Distribution Modelling
# ============================================

# A practical guide to modeling species distributions using R
# Originally by Tim Barraclough (tim.barraclough@biology.ox.ac.uk)
# Modified by Nilo M. Recalde (nilo.recalde@biology.ox.ac.uk)
# Based on tutorials from: https://rspatial.org/raster/sdm/

# This script demonstrates how to:
# 1. Download and process world map data
# 2. Obtain species locality data from GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
# 3. Access climate data from WorldClim
# 4. Model species distributions based on climate variables
# 5. Predict future distributions under climate change scenarios

# The approach used here employs basic linear modelling to identify which climate variables 
# best predict current species distributions, project how distributions might shift with 
# future climate change, and visualize results using maps. Note that while this script uses 
# simple linear models, many other approaches exist for species distribution modeling (SDM).

# Load the libraries providing functions for spatial data handling and mapping.
# If you haven't installed these packages yet, see the setup script.

library(geodata)
library(rgbif)
library(tidyverse) # works well for pipes! (rather than pipes)

# Now let's create a simple project structure if it doesn't exist:
# This script ensures that the required directories (data/raw, data/processed, and output) 
# exist in the project directory. If they donâ€™t, it creates them:
#   create a folder called data 
sapply(c("data/raw", "data/processed", "output"), function(dir) { #creating different folders in the directory 
  dir_path <- here(dir)
  if (!dir.exists(dir_path)) dir.create(dir_path, recursive = TRUE)
}) 

# ==============================
# 1) Load world map and plot it
# ==============================

#Essentially this creates a wolrd map that can then be used to plot the species distributions on 
wrld_simpl <- getMap(# getMap(resolution = "coarse") is a function from the {rworldmap} package that retrieves a spatial object representing a world map.
  resolution = "coarse") # resolution means a simplified version of the map with fewer details (faster to render).
plot(wrld_simpl) # The result is stored in wrld_simpl, which is a spatial polygons object. Plots this!!


# ===========================================================
# 2) Download locality data for a species from GBIF and trim
# ===========================================================

# Access records from GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) for a species using the dismo package.
# I am looking at , the spruce species used for ... production.
# The function gbif() downloads data for a species, and the geo argument specifies that we want only records 
# with geographic coordinates.

# ======================================================================
# 3) Extract climatic values for the localities occupied by the species
# ======================================================================

# Download bioclimatic data from the worldclim database and convert to Raster format
bio.data <- worldclim_global(var = "bio", res = 10, path = here("data", "raw"))
names(bio.data) <- paste0("bio", 1:19)

# The bio.data object contains 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim
# Each variable represents different aspects of temperature and precipitation
# See full descriptions at: https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html
# 
# Examples:
# BIO1 = Annual Mean Temperature
# BIO2 = Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp - min temp))
# BIO3 = Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (Ã—100)
# ...
#
# The data is stored as a RasterStack, where each layer is one bioclimatic variable, 
# each pixel represents a 10 arc-minute (~18.5km) grid cell, and the pixel values 
# contain the climate data

# the resolution is 18.5 km quite big - may not be very in tune with species populations (coarse reolution)
# there might be a better database for a specific region with greater resolution
# 

# Let's visualise the first two variables:
plot(bio.data, 1, main="Annual Mean Temperature")
plot(bio.data, 2, main="Mean Diurnal Range")

# You can extract bioclimatic data for the focal localities in Africa where your species is found
# filtering data for just the focal region
bio.values <- extract(bio.data, species.coords)[, -1]
rownames(bio.values) <- rownames(species.coords)

# And plot them to see the range of environmental values the species lives in
plot(bio.values[, 1], bio.values[, 2])
# just visuakising correltaion but could be good to plot a linear model!

# Or look at how different variables correlate; here focusing on the first five:
pairs(bio.values[, 1:5])
# evryhting agaisnt evrtyhing - just to identify correlations!!
# if two explanatory variables are corralted they might itnroduce confoudnign variables 

# Append to lat long, remove rows with missing data, and save to file for future use
species.data <- cbind(species.coords, bio.values)
write.csv(species.data, file = here("data", "processed", "species_data.csv"), row.names = FALSE)

# Extract mean values, min and max, as a sanity check for the data
#     jsut to check for big mistakes 
rbind(
  mean = colMeans(species.data),
  min = apply(species.data, 2, min),
  max = apply(species.data, 2, max)
)

# =========================================================================
# 4) Model the species current distribution based on bioclimatic variables
# =========================================================================

# We will build a model to predict species presence (1) or absence (0) using bioclimatic variables (X). 
# However, we donâ€™t have true absence dataâ€”locations where we are certain the species is not present. 
#   we only have presence data (not absence)
# Without absence data, the model cannot distinguish between areas where the species might be absent 
# and areas we simply havenâ€™t surveyed. 
# To address this, we generate "pseudo-absence" data by sampling random background points from the region, 
# assuming these locations represent areas where the species is unlikely to occur. 
# Pseudo-absence is essential because it provides a contrast to presence data, 
# allowing the model to learn patterns associated with species occurrence.
#   We need data for absence and presence if we are to poredict how the species distribution chanegs over time 

# Question 1: What are the limitations of this approach?
#   Assuming that the random point extracted in the making of pseudo-absence really represents absence
#   Whilst it is likely that this assumption is correct (no sample data = no presence) it might not be the case at all!
#   So for example socio-political factors could prevent sampling 
#   Additionally, if it is growing in very rural and isoalted areas then it migth be less sampled 
# look at where the species is endemic! perhaps it is jsut sampled where there is a plantation!!
# 


# 4.1) Generate random background points for comparison

# Define study extent based on species occurrence data (with some buffer around it)
e <- extent(
  min(species.coords$lon) - 5,
  max(species.coords$lon) + 5,
  min(species.coords$lat) - 5,
  max(species.coords$lat) + 5
)

# Create a mask from the world map for the study region
mask <- rasterize(wrld_simpl, raster(e, res=0.5))

# Generate 500 random background points within the study region
bg <- randomPoints(mask, 500, ext=e)
colnames(bg) <- c("lon", "lat")

# Visualize the results
plot(crop(wrld_simpl, e), col="grey90", legend=FALSE, border = NA, 
     main="Species occurrences and background points")
points(bg, col="black", pch=20, cex=0.7)
points(species.coords, col="red", pch=20, cex=0.7)

# Question 2: Why is it better not to have too large a region for your background?
# The larger they are the larger the uncertainty and larger the error?
# The more likely there will actually be presence of the sepcies 
# 
# Question 3: Do you think C. arabica is really absent from all the
# localities selected as background points? Will it matter?
#   Np, it is unlikel to be abesnt forom all of those areas, because wuite liarhe areas and may o them 
#   Sampling efforts 
#   
#   This will matter if then we are predicting future scenarios; it needs to be considered 
#   The corealtions and assumptiosn we make might not be accurate and this our futrue preictions would eb worng 
# 

# Now we are settled on our area of extent, we can crop the bio.data to just keep values for this region
# It isn't essential but speeds up some later steps
bio.data <- crop(bio.data, e)


# 4.2 Next step: combine the presence data and the background data in one data frame

train <- rbind(species.coords, bg)
# Create a vector of 1s and 0s to indicate presence/absence
pb_train <- c(rep(1, nrow(species.coords)), rep(0, nrow(bg)))
# Extract the bioclimatic data for the presence and background points
envtrain <- extract(bio.data, train)
envtrain <- data.frame(cbind(pa = pb_train, envtrain))
# And for each set separately
testpres <- data.frame(extract(bio.data, species.coords))
testbackg <- data.frame(extract(bio.data, bg))


# 4.3 Now we are ready to fit a logistic regression to predict presence/absence.
# We use a general linear model assuming binomial errors, which is appropriate
# for modelling a binary Y variable of 0s and 1s.
# More on this in Year 2 lecture Analysis of associations Part III: Non-Linear Regression Bonsall, Michael, and in Year 4!

# To start with I am including the first 5 bioclim variables as predictors, but you could include 1,2, or more.
gm1 <- glm(pa ~ bio1 + bio2 + bio3 + bio4 + bio5,
           family = binomial #binomial distribution for binary data ()
           (link = "logit"), data = envtrain
)

#correlation?? if you put them both in then you might not 
# reducing the power 

# Look at a summary of the results
summary(gm1)
# intercept = basiline probability 
# how much it deviates for, the estiamte
# relationshipo betwene the variabeks  

# Question 4: Which variables contribute significantly to explaining presence/absence?
# Here it says that all 5 variables seem to contribute signficnaty
# However this is likely to vayr under a different absnece data set!!
# This ussggetss that there is a lot of uncertainty 
# 
# Look at effect size!!! seemingly bio1 and bio2 and bio5!!
# 
# Finding the balacne!!
# 

# 4.4 Predict species distribution from the model and plot it
# Based on the model, we can predict the probability of occurrence of the species
# across the whole of the area being considered
pg <- predict(bio.data, gm1, ext = e, type = "response")
pg <- crop(pg, e)

# pg is a raster layer, like for our bioclim variables, but now representing the
# probability of occurrence from our linear model, for or area of extent e.

# Plot this
plot(pg, main = "GLM probability of occurrence")
# Add country boundaries
plot(wrld_simpl, add = TRUE, border = "dark grey")
#good for geo-political analyses
# Add our observed locality data
points(species.coords, col="red", pch=20, cex=1.5)

# Question 5: How well do you think the model has predicted the distribution?

# If you want to show a single map of distribution instead, can convert the
# probabilities by selecting a threshold that gives the best match between predicted
# and observed localities.

# First, we evaluate how well the model predicts presence/absence at each point
ge <- evaluate(testpres, testbackg, gm1)
print(ge)

# The output gives several metrics such as:
# Area Under the Curve: AUC, and correlation coefficient between observed and predicted.
# Higher values of both metrics = better match between model predictions and observed
# presence/absences.

# Then we use this evaluation to pick a threshold probability for defining presence/absence
# using the model that gives the most accurate match to observed presence/absence
tr <- threshold(ge, "prevalence")
plot(pg > tr, main = "presence/absence")
plot(wrld_simpl, add = TRUE, border = "dark grey")

# 4.5 You can construct and compare different models

# This model uses next 5 climatic variables instead
gm2 <- glm(pa ~ bio6 + bio7 + bio8 + bio9 + bio10, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = envtrain)
summary(gm2)

# You can compare two models, even with different predictor variables, using the Akaike Information Criterion
AIC(gm1, gm2)

# AIC helps compare model fit vs complexity (lower = more parsimonious)
# While differences >2 units suggest meaningful differences between models,
# model selection should be guided by theory and research questions,
# not just by AIC or p-values. Consider multiple evaluation metrics and
# use cross-validation when possible, and give enough thought to what your aims are: do you want to 
# predict well, or understand the underlying biology?

# You can try fitting different models with different predictor variables, but
# remember that the more variables you test, the more likely you are to overfit the observed data, which can 
# lead to poor predictions on new data.

# You can also compare metrics of how well the model predicts the data
evaluate(testpres, testbackg, gm1)
evaluate(testpres, testbackg, gm2)

# Question 6: Which bioclimatic variables do you expect to be most important for the species?
# Does a model including these variables predict distribution better than alternatives?

# 5) Predict future distributions under climate change scenarios
# =========================================================================


# Step 1: Download future climate projections
# We'll use CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) data, specifically for the time 
# period: 2061-2080, using one selected climate model (from many available), and with one set of parameters.
# Note that while CMIP5 contains many models and scenarios, we're using just one
# combination to demonstrate the methods

future.bio.data <- cmip6_world(
  model = "CanESM5",
  var = "bio", 
  ssp = "245",
  res = 10,
  time = "2061-2080",
  path = here("data", "raw")
)
names(future.bio.data) <- names(bio.data)

# Crop future climate data to region of interest for efficiency
future.bio.data <- crop(future.bio.data, e)

# Fit model with present data
gm1 <- glm(pa ~ bio1 + bio2 + bio3 + bio4 + bio5,
           family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = envtrain
)

# Calculate predictions for present and future
pg <- predict(bio.data, gm1, ext = e, type = "response")
pg <- crop(pg, e)
pg.future <- predict(future.bio.data, gm1, ext = e, type = "response")
pg.future <- crop(pg.future, e)

# Plot results side by side
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

# Present distribution
plot(pg, main = "A) GLM present")
plot(wrld_simpl, add = TRUE, border = "dark grey")
points(species.coords, col = "black", pch = 4, cex = 0.5)

# Future distribution
plot(pg.future, main = "B) GLM, 2060-2081")
plot(wrld_simpl, add = TRUE, border = "dark grey")
points(species.coords, col = "black", pch = 4, cex = 0.5)

# Question 7: How is the distribution of the species expected to change in the future?

# Extract counts for range changes
# First, get predictions for present and future at all localities
predict.localities.now <- extract(pg >= tr, species.coords)[, -1]
predict.localities.future <- extract(pg.future >= tr, species.coords)[, -1]

# We can extract some numbers about how the range will change, for example:
present_range <- sum(predict.localities.now)
future_range <- sum(predict.localities.future, na.rm = TRUE)
range_expansion <- sum((predict.localities.now == 0) & (predict.localities.future == 1), na.rm = TRUE)
range_contraction <- sum((predict.localities.now == 1) & (predict.localities.future == 0), na.rm = TRUE)

# Print results in a clear format

print(paste("Current suitable localities:", present_range))
print(paste("Future suitable localities:", future_range))
print(paste("Number of new suitable localities (expansion):", range_expansion))
print(paste("Number of lost suitable localities (contraction):", range_contraction))


# Question 8: Use these numbers to calculate the percentage contraction or expansion in the range.

# A final plot that can be useful to understand causes of changes is one showing how climate will change

# Work out the change in bioclim variables from now to the future
change.bio.data <- future.bio.data - bio.data

# plot present, future and change in climate for bioclim 1 variable, mean annual temperature.
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(bio.data[[1]], ext = e, main = "Present Day")
plot(future.bio.data[[1]], ext = e, main = "2061-2080")
plot(change.bio.data[[1]], ext = e, main = "Projected Change")
